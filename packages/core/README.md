## What is it?

- Batteries not included (yes, that's a good thing ðŸ˜„). The core package is only an engine, the rest is up to presets.

- Incredibly fast. Built from the ground up, no matter how you use it, it's fast.

- Unopinionated. You can use it standalone, with a bundler like [vite](https://vitejs.dev), or with a framework like [svelte](https://svelte.dev)[^1].
